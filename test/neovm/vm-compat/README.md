# NeoVM Compatibility Oracle Scaffold

This directory provides a minimal GNU Emacs oracle harness for compatibility testing.

## Goal

Capture canonical GNU Emacs results for a corpus of Elisp forms, then compare NeoVM
results against that baseline once evaluator execution is wired in.

## Files

- `oracle_eval.el`: batch-mode evaluator used as the GNU Emacs oracle
- `run-oracle.sh`: runs all forms from a corpus file and prints TSV output
- `run-neovm.sh`: runs NeoVM core compatibility runner and prints TSV output
- `compare-results.sh`: diffs oracle TSV vs NeoVM TSV
- `cases/core.forms`: starter corpus for expression and error behavior

## Usage

```bash
test/neovm/vm-compat/run-oracle.sh test/neovm/vm-compat/cases/core.forms
test/neovm/vm-compat/run-neovm.sh test/neovm/vm-compat/cases/core.forms
```

Output columns:

1. source line number
2. input form
3. oracle result (`OK <value>` or `ERR <signal+data>`)

## Baseline Workflow

```bash
cd test/neovm/vm-compat
make record   # writes cases/core.expected.tsv
make check    # diffs fresh oracle output against expected
```

When NeoVM produces TSV output for the same corpus:

```bash
cd test/neovm/vm-compat
make compare NEOVM_OUT=cases/core.neovm.tsv
make check-neovm
```

`compare-results.sh` checks index/form/result equality and reports drift.
Set `STRICT_FORM=1` to fail on form-printing differences too.

## Next step

Add a NeoVM runner that evaluates the same corpus and diffs against this oracle output.
